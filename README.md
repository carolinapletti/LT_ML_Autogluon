# LT_machine_learning
I ran this project as an excercise for the WIFI course on Data Science and Business Analytics. I to try to predict how much two people like each other based on how similar their neural signal is during an interaction and while watching videos. Data are taken from my project "Laughing Together". Results show that even the best model selected by AutoGLuon does not yield a good performance if compared to a "baseline" model (which always predicts the average liking score for every participant). This does not come as a surprise, given the small sample size (I excluded all participants with any missing value from the dataset), the redundancy of the predictors (e.g., both participants in a pair have the same neural coherence values) and the little variance in the outcome variable.
